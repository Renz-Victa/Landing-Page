# Landing-Page

This page includes a section to grab attention to the user right away, and navigation links that show a real webiste experience. The call-to-action buttons are placed throughout the page to show how the Landing Page guides users to interact, while the footer adds a bit of personality to the project.

I focused on improving my front-end fundamentals, including: 
- Writing clean HTML code
- Styling layouts with CSS
- Creating a visually friendly design

In conclusion, this project is a part of my journey in learning web development and improving how I design websites that look interesting to the human eye...
